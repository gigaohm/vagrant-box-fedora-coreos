# vagrant-box-fedora-coreos

A project for building [Fedora CoreOS](https://getfedora.org/en/coreos?stream=stable) boxes for Vagrant.

Based upon the work from https://github.com/mihailutasu/vagrant-fedora-coreos

## Requirements
- [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
- [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (or FCCT installed) - to generate your own Ignition files
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) - if you want to download the latest images of CoreOS
## Config

In `config.ign.yml` you'll find a [YAML-formatted Butane config](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/producing-ign/).
It must [conform to the Spec](https://coreos.github.io/butane/specs/).
The password generated for the config is `packer` which was generated by [coreos mkpasswd](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/authentication/#_using_password_authentication).

If you update it you can generate the `transpiled_config.ign`:

```shell
./util/makeign.sh
```

This outputs the Ignition config used in the install. It will be used by packer to perform the [coreos-installer pxe ignition wrap](https://coreos.github.io/coreos-installer/cmd/pxe/#coreos-installer-pxe-ignition-wrap).

### Latest version of CoreOS

You might also want to update `stable.pkrvars.hcl` file first, to the latest versions:

```shell
./update_vars.sh
```

## Usage

To build a box, you need to run packer.

```shell
packer build -var-file="stable.pkrvars.hcl" fedora-coreos.pkr.hcl
```

This will download the ISO image (if not already in packer's cache) and will build the box.

### Using pre-built boxes
You can also add the pre-built boxes in Vagrant:

```shell
vagrant box add gigaohm/fedora-coreos
```
