# vagrant-box-fedora-coreos

A project for building [Fedora CoreOS](https://getfedora.org/en/coreos?stream=stable) boxes for Vagrant.

Based upon the work from https://github.com/mihailutasu/vagrant-fedora-coreos
## Requirements
- [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
- [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (or FCCT installed) - to generate your own Ignition files
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) - if you want to download the latest images of CoreOS
## Config

In `config.ign.yml` you'll find a [YAML-formatted Butane config](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/producing-ign/).
It must [conform to the Spec](https://coreos.github.io/butane/specs/).
The password generated for the config is `packer` which was generated by [coreos mkpasswd](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/authentication/#_using_password_authentication).

If you update it you can generate the `transpiled_config.ign`:

```shell
./util/makeign.sh
```

This outputs the Ignition config used in the install. It will be used by packer to perform the [coreos-installer pxe ignition wrap](https://coreos.github.io/coreos-installer/cmd/pxe/#coreos-installer-pxe-ignition-wrap).

## Secrets to upload to Vagrant Cloud

Your access token is needed for the Vagrant Cloud API. This can be generated on your [tokens page](https://app.vagrantup.com/settings/security). Populate a `secrets.pkrvars.hcl`:

```shell
cat << EOF > ./secrets.pkrvars.hcl
cloud_token = "abc123.atlasv1.xyzabc"
EOF
```

## Usage

To build a box, you need to

 - Make sure the box is created https://app.vagrantup.com/gigaohm/boxes/fedora-coreos
 - Pick your [next version](https://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#semantic-versioning), e.g. `1.0.0`
 - Run packer with your local variable for the version number:

```shell
packer build \
  -var "box_version=1.0.0" \
  -var-file="secrets.pkrvars.hcl" \
  -var-file="stable.pkrvars.hcl" \
  fedora-coreos.pkr.hcl
```

This will download the ISO image (if not already in packer's cache) and will build the box.

You might also want to update `stable.pkrvars.hcl` file first, to the latest versions:

```shell
./update_vars.sh
```

### Using pre-built boxes
You can also add the pre-built boxes in Vagrant:

```shell
vagrant box add gigaohm/fedora-coreos
```
